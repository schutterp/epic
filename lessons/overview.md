## Lesson 1 "Toolkit"

2015/11/22

Spent ~30 min going over the epic site in the **chrome dev tools**
Learned about:
-the **Network tab**, showing the **waterfall** (the requests made by the browser when the page is loading)
-**user agent string** used in the `deviceDetector.js` script* *this kind of device detection is not a best practice: one of the main reasons being it is unreliable and can be changed easily
-**json** pronounced 'Jayson' is the best way to get data from an **API**. Make a request to an api for information (not a new page) and it is in the json format
-in the json we saw **arrays** and **objects**
Remainder of time spent on **`git`**

*@cody HW*:
-create your own git repository and make a branch with multiple commits
-clone the `epic` repo and make a new branch and make some changes, then push the branch to origin (which is github)
