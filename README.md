# Node Tutorial

This is a basic web dev tutorial using *javascript, git, node, npm, html*. I am creating this for my little brother, Cody Schutte. Wish him luck on his journey to learn the secrets of the javascripts.

The name `epic` was taken from NASA's DSCOVR:EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) because we are taking data from their EPIC project.

Where will this take us? Let's find out...

## First Steps

1.
```
$ pwd
> ~/project
```
2. `$ git init epic`
3. add a `.gitignore` file for node_modules directory
2. `$ cd epic`
3. `$ npm init --yes`
4. `$ npm install htmlparser2 --save`
5. `$ npm install request --save`
4. create index.js
6. `git add .`
7. `git commit -m 'my first commit'`

## Fun other stuff to come:

-define npm run for babel... it should do the request and we could demonstrate passing options
-use trumpet
-build a web interface
